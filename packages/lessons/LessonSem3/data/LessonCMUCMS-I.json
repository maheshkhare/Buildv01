           "Para":"Liza has loved words for as long as she can remember. She loves the sounds words make, the shapes of words, and the way letters are arranged in words. Some of her favorite words are lollipop, balloon and purple. When Liza has free time at school, she likes to write down words and decide on the letters to create fun drawings. Sometimes she takes the drawings home to her parents, and sometimes her teacher pins them to the classroom bulletin board. One day, Liza’s art teacher, Mr. Jordan, walked into her classroom and noticed one of Liza’s recent pieces of word art. He was very impressed with her creativity and her word choice. After all, not many fourth graders know the word sanctuary and how to spell it. Let alone know what it means. Liza’s word art turned the word sanctuary into a beautiful image with birds, rabbits and butterflies in a natural, undisturbed setting with trees and a pond. Mr. Jordan waited until the class went to recess, and then talked to Liza’s teacher, Mrs. Roberts, about Liza’s talent. Mrs. Roberts said, “She is a very good artist, and she is also quite talented at spelling.“I’m sure the fact that she turns the letters of words into characters and images to form her artistic pieces helps her remember the spellings. She could do very well in a spelling bee, and her doodling would help her study,” said Mr. Jordan. “I could help her too by creating word art with her,” he added. “That’s a great idea. I will ask Liza if she is interested in entering the spelling bee.” Mrs. Roberts replied. “It is only three weeks away, so she would have to study pretty hard,” she added. Later that day Mrs. Roberts asked Liza if she could stay for a couple of minutes after class dismissal. Liza asked Mrs. Roberts if she was in trouble, and Mrs. Roberts replied, “Quite the contrary.” Liza was still nervous, but she stayed to see what her teacher wanted. When Liza found out Mrs. Roberts wanted her to enter the spelling bee, she was thrilled and honored. Usually only fifth graders enter the spelling bee. Liza was even more excited when she heard that Mr. Jordan was going to help her study with the use of art. Liza and Mr. Jordan met every day after school for the next three weeks. Mrs. Roberts had given them word lists to study. Liza studied hard by turning each word into a drawing. When she wasn’t sure what a word meant. Mr. Jordan would tell her and help her come up with an idea for the word art. When the big day arrived, Liza felt well prepared, but she was still nervous. There were 26 fifth graders and 3 fourth graders in the spelling bee.After the first three rounds, there were still 21 contestants. Liza was one of them. Liza was holding her own and continued to successfully spell di cult words including economy, avenue, tissue and station over the next several rounds. She knew her word art was helping her succeed because she could visualize the words. After six more rounds, there were only three contestants remaining - Liza and two fifth graders. It was Liza’s turn to spell. Her word was migration. She remembered drawing flying ducks for the word. She pictured her art, and spelled the word correctly. One of the fifth graders wasn’t so lucky during this round, and it was now down to Liza and one other contestant, a boy named Ben. Ben went first in this round. He was given a word that Liza knew very well, valley, Ben knew the word too and spelled it without a neck. Now Liza had to spell her word correctly to stay in the bee, otherwise, Ben would win. She listened carefully as her word was announced. The word sounded familiar, but it wasn’t one of the words she had studied. The word was tolerable. Liza thought about words that contained similar sounds. She knew how to spell tolerate and notable. Could she use that knowledge to spell tolerable? She did, and it worked. Liza made it to the next round.Ben listened to his next word and hesitated for quite a while. He took his time and eventually spelled ceremony correctly. Liza’s next word was deception. This too was a word she had not studied. She thought and thought about the word and listened to the sounds, but in the end, she was one letter off in her spelling. Liza was slightly sad she didn’t win, but at the same time she was proud of herself for making it this far in her first spelling bee. Plus she knew she could come back next year and try again.",

Later that day Mrs. Roberts asked Liza if she could stay for a couple of minutes after class dismissal. Liza asked Mrs. Roberts if she was in trouble, and Mrs. Roberts replied, “Quite the contrary.” Liza was still nervous, but she stayed to see what her teacher wanted. When Liza found out Mrs. Roberts wanted her to enter the spelling bee, she was thrilled and honored. Usually only fifth graders enter the spelling bee. Liza was even more excited when she heard that Mr. Jordan was going to help her study with the use of art. Liza and Mr. Jordan met every day after school for the next three weeks. Mrs. Roberts had given them word lists to study. Liza studied hard by turning each word into a drawing. When she wasn’t sure what a word meant. Mr. Jordan would tell her and help her come up with an idea for the word art. When the big day arrived, Liza felt well prepared, but she was still nervous. There were 26 fifth graders and 3 fourth graders in the spelling bee.After the first three rounds, there were still 21 contestants. Liza was one of them. Liza was holding her own and continued to successfully spell di cult words including economy, avenue, tissue and station over the next several rounds. She knew her word art was helping her succeed because she could visualize the words. After six more rounds, there were only three contestants remaining - Liza and two fifth graders. It was Liza’s turn to spell. Her word was migration. She remembered drawing flying ducks for the word. She pictured her art, and spelled the word correctly. One of the fifth graders wasn’t so lucky during this round, and it was now down to Liza and one other contestant, a boy named Ben. Ben went first in this round. He was given a word that Liza knew very well, valley, Ben knew the word too and spelled it without a neck. Now Liza had to spell her word correctly to stay in the bee, otherwise, Ben would win. She listened carefully as her word was announced. The word sounded familiar, but it wasn’t one of the words she had studied. The word was tolerable. Liza thought about words that contained similar sounds. She knew how to spell tolerate and notable. Could she use that knowledge to spell tolerable? She did, and it worked. Liza made it to the next round.Ben listened to his next word and hesitated for quite a while. He took his time and eventually spelled ceremony correctly. Liza’s next word was deception. This too was a word she had not studied. She thought and thought about the word and listened to the sounds, but in the end, she was one letter off in her spelling. Liza was slightly sad she didn’t win, but at the same time she was proud of herself for making it this far in her first spelling bee. Plus she knew she could come back next year and try again.",

           "Para":"Liza has loved words for as long as she can remember. She loves the sounds words make, the shapes of words, and the way letters are arranged in words. Some of her favorite words are lollipop, balloon and purple. When Liza has free time at school, she likes to write down words and decide on the letters to create fun drawings. Sometimes she takes the drawings home to her parents, and sometimes her teacher pins them to the classroom bulletin board. One day, Liza’s art teacher, Mr. Jordan, walked into her classroom and noticed one of Liza’s recent pieces of word art. He was very impressed with her creativity and her word choice. After all, not many fourth graders know the word sanctuary and how to spell it. Let alone know what it means. Liza’s word art turned the word sanctuary into a beautiful image with birds, rabbits and butterflies in a natural, undisturbed setting with trees and a pond. Mr. Jordan waited until the class went to recess, and then talked to Liza’s teacher, Mrs. Roberts, about Liza’s talent. Mrs. Roberts said, “She is a very good artist, and she is also quite talented at spelling.“I’m sure the fact that she turns the letters of words into characters and images to form her artistic pieces helps her remember the spellings. She could do very well in a spelling bee, and her doodling would help her study,” said Mr. Jordan. “I could help her too by creating word art with her,” he added. “That’s a great idea.

Each treasure map had an explanation for where it was found, and what the treasure was supposed to be. The stories were exciting, and Susie, Danny, and Fred let their minds run wild. They wished there was a treasure map in their town for them to explore. What a fun adventure he would tell? They were getting around the end of the book when a slip of paper fell out. \"Wow, this book must be really old, it's falling apart!\" Fred said. Danny opened the paper. It had the name of their town on top, and it was a map of their town! There was a marking on the map. The friends looked closer. It looked like the markings on the other maps in the book, and that meant one thing: treasure! The end of the school day couldn't come fast enough - they wanted to go on their own adventure! After school, the friends met at Danny's house. They had talked to their parents and looked at the treasure map with them, and Danny's parents had agreed to drive them around to try to find the treasure. The friends piled in the car. \"Where to?\" Danny's dad asked. Susie looked at the map. The trail started at the pool in the middle of town, so Susie told that to Danny's dad. Susie gave the map to Fred to take a turn giving directions. He directed them to turn left by the pool, and head towards the library, then handed the map to Danny. Danny looked at the map, and saw that they were almost there! They turned right by the grocery store, and stopped at the park. \"Wow, that's true. It was so fun going on a treasure hunt with you both. Let's sign our names!\" The friends carved their names, and Danny's dad took a picture of them all with the tree. Even though they didn't get to keep anything, they agreed that it was a great day. Trickensafe™ 2021 Events CD All rights reserved. Trickensafe™ 2021 Energia SDL All rights reserved.",

Scott hated warm weather and asked if he could just stay at his best friend's house so he could snowboard every day with his buddies at the local mountain. His parents didn't want to hear anything of it. He kept debating them about the topic, but they would not change their minds. Family time was important to them, and it was tradition that they spend winter break together. The week of the cruise arrived, and Scott continued to mumble his complaints as he and his family left their house to head south. Scott's dad told him that he would only make the vacation worse for himself if he didn't change his attitude and open his mind to a new experience. Scott still couldn't stop thinking about all of the snow he was leaving behind. When they arrived at the port to board the ship, Scott had a hard time admitting that he was actually impressed with the size of the ship. He had seen the brochures but seeing the ship in person was a whole different animal. Then he remembered that the brochure said something about a surfing pool. Maybe surfing would be somewhat like snowboarding. After all, it involved riding a board. Scott climbed aboard the ship with his parents, and then they walked around to check everything out. He couldn't believe how extravagant the accommodations were. The dining room looked like a royal hall; the game room had all of his favorite games and then some: the ship's deck had several different swimming pools for different purposes. Then Scott saw the surfing pool. It was incredible. It wasn't a big pool, but it had big waves, and the girl who was demonstrating how to ride the waves made it look like a ton of fun. Scott asked his parents if he could go put his swim shorts on so that he could try surfing. They said, \"Of course.\" They wanted to put their swim suits on as well, and, much to Scott's surprise, they wanted to try surfing too. When Scott and his parents had their swim suits on, they headed back to the surfing pool. There was a line, but it wasn't too long. Scott's dad went first and only lasted about five seconds before he wiped out. Then it was his mom's turn. She actually made it longer than his dad did. When it was Scott's turn, he was excited and nervous. He hopped on the board and took a stance similar to his snowboarding stance. Then the waves started. It felt similar to snowboarding but different at the same time. On his first ride, Scott rode for almost 30 seconds before wiping out. He was hooked though. Trademark ™ 2021 Energia SOI.

The dining room looked like a royal hall; the game room had all of his favorite games and then some: the ship's deck had several different swimming pools for different purposes. Then Scott saw the surfing pool. It was incredible. It wasn't a big pool, but it had big waves, and the girl who was demonstrating how to ride the waves made it look like a ton of fun. Scott asked his parents if he could go put his swim shorts on so that he could try surfing. They said, \"Of course.\" They wanted to put their swim suits on as well, and, much to Scott's surprise, they wanted to try surfing too. When Scott and his parents had their swim suits on, they headed back to the surfing pool. There was a line, but it wasn't too long. Scott's dad went first and only lasted about five seconds before he wiped out. Then it was his mom's turn. She actually made it longer than his dad did. When it was Scott's turn, he was excited and nervous. He hopped on the board and took a stance similar to his snowboarding stance. Then the waves started. It felt similar to snowboarding but different at the same time. On his first ride, Scott rode for almost 30 seconds before wiping out. He was hooked though. Trademark ™ 2021 Energia SOI.

            "Para": "Winter break was fast approaching, and all Scott wanted to do was go snowboarding. Unfortunately, Scott's parents had different plans. They had booked a weeklong tropical cruise. Scott hated warm weather and asked if he could just stay at his best friend's house so he could snowboard every day with his buddies at the local mountain. His parents didn't want to hear anything of it. He kept debating them about the topic, but they would not change their minds. Family time was important to them, and it was tradition that they spend winter break together. The week of the cruise arrived, and Scott continued to mumble his complaints as he and his family left their house to head south. Scott's dad told him that he would only make the vacation worse for himself if he didn't change his attitude and open his mind to a new experience. Scott still couldn't stop thinking about all of the snow he was leaving behind. When they arrived at the port to board the ship, Scott had a hard time admitting that he was actually impressed with the size of the ship. He had seen the brochures but seeing the ship in person was a whole different animal. Then he remembered that the brochure said something about a surfing pool.

Josie jumped out of the car, and Trish could hear a lot of voices laughing and saying goodbye to Josie. Trish stopped dribbling the basketball and watched as the car drove away and Josie skipped to her front door. Trish could feel her body start to get uncomfortably warm, and her eyes started to water. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" Daniel asked. \"Nothing. I don't want to play anymore.\" Trish stormed inside and slammed the door. She heard the door open again behind her, but she didn't turn around and went straight to her room. Trish could hear Daniel talking to her mom downstairs, but she didn't want to talk to anyone. How could Josie do that to me? Trish thought. I thought we were friends. She heard a knock on the door, but ignored it. Her mom called through the door, \"Trish, are you OK?\" Trish ignored it and put her pillow over her head like earmuffs. \"I'll be downstairs if you want to talk later. It's a good choice to calm yourself down first.\" Eventually Trish calmed down and went to talk with her mom. Her mom always had some good ideas to help her. \"What's going on, Trish?\" Mom asked when Trish appeared in the living room. Trish took a seat. \"Josie went somewhere with our friends and she didn't invite me,\" Trish said. \"Why wouldn't she invite me? That's not very nice. I thought we were friends.\" \"Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'd be pretty upset too if I felt left out. Maybe Josie knew that you wouldn't like what they were going to do,\" Mom suggested. \"Maybe...\" Trish didn't sound convinced. \"Why don't you talk with Josie about it at school on Monday?\" Mom said. \"I don't want to talk to her, I'm mad! I'm just going to ignore her.\" \"Well... sometimes ignoring another person is a good choice, but I don't think this is the right time for that solution. If you ignore her, how are you ever going to solve the problem? Not talking about it is just going to make it worse, and might mean you could lose Josie as a friend,\" replied Mom. \"I still want Josie to be my friend, but talking about it is uncomfortable. I just want her to know what's wrong and say she's sorry.\" \"That might happen, but it might not. Josie might not realize that she did something wrong, so then she'll just get mad at you for ignoring her. I really think talking to her about how you feel is the best way to solve the problem.\" \"OK, Mom, I'll talk to her at school. Thanks,\" Trish said. And guess what? Trish's mom was right! Josie knew Trish didn't like snakes, and she and the other girls had gone to the zoo to see the new snake exhibit. Trish was glad she'd talked to Josie to solve the problem.

The view of the zoo was fantastic, but Marty was too scared to appreciate it. They were climbing in the air, and Marty knew he had to do something or he was going to be the hawk's lunch. Think, think, think! He said to himself. The hawk's talons were surrounding him, but he had an idea. There was one talon close to his face, so he took a deep breath, and bit the hawk! The hawk screeched but didn't let go. Marty did it again, chomping his little mouse jaws as hard as he possibly could. Then, he was falling. Marty didn't even have a chance to think about anything but the feeling of falling, until, THUMP! He landed on an umbrella, bounced off another one, and went flying into the bushes. He landed safely in the dirt. For a while, Marty stayed still. He could not believe that he was still alive. He didn't want to move in case the hawk came back. Finally, his breathing started to slow. He was sore from hitting the ground, but he didn't feel seriously hurt. Marty stood up, and made his way to the closest tunnel. He was ready to be home. That was enough of an adventure for one day.
