It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst. When he entered the forest there met him a little grey-haired old man who bade him good-day, and said, 'Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.' But the prudent youth answered, 'If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,' and he left the little man standing and went on. But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man's doing.",

One day, old Mrs. Rabbit called the four little rabbits for a little talk. 'Listen to me,' she said, 'I know that you like to run and play all around the place, but I advise you not to go to Mr. McGregor's garden. Do you know why?' Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter shook their heads. 'Your father was killed in Mr. McGregor's garden. Mrs. McGregor put him in a pie,' mother rabbit said solemnly. The four little rabbits looked as though they understood their mother's message. 'Alright then, go and play, but don't get into trouble. I have to go out now,' mother rabbit said. She took her umbrella and her basket, and set out to the baker's. She had to buy a few currant buns and a loaf of brown bread.
