      "Para": "In the freezing ocean waters of Antarctica, the planet's largest seals make their home in a frozen world. These giants are southern elephant seals, and they can grow as long as the length of a car and weigh as much as two cars combined. The name \"elephant seal\" comes from both the males' enormous size and from their giant trunk-like nose, called a proboscis. Females do not have a proboscis and they are much smaller. A thick layer of blubber keeps southern elephant seals warm in their icy habitat. The seals are clumsy on land, but in water they're graceful swimmers and incredible divers. They can easily dive 1,000 to 4,000 feet to hunt for squid, octopus, and various kinds of fish. Elephant seals are able to stay underwater for 20 minutes or more. The longest underwater session researchers observed for an amazing two hours! When they return to the surface to breathe, it's only for a few minutes. Then they dive again. While elephant seals spend most of their time swimming, they also gather on beaches in groups called colonies. One reason they come to land is to give birth and breed. Males arrive before females. They battle for dominance, deciding who will have large harems of females. Raising their enormous bodies, the males inflate their snouts and bellow. Usually these confrontations end quickly. However, sometimes only a physical battle can settle the matter. These fights can be bloody, but permanent injury is rare. Females arriving on land give birth to a single pup they've been carrying since the previous year. Newborns weigh about 90 pounds. The mother nurses her pup for a little over three weeks. After this, she breeds with a dominant male and then returns to the sea to feed. Her pup now weighs well over 200 pounds and is on its own. If it survives, it too will enter the sea within a couple of months. A second reason elephant seals come to land is to molt. When they molt, they shed old skin and fur and new skin and fur grows. A smaller species, the northern elephant seal, lives in the Pacific Ocean, dispersed from Baja, California to Alaska. Both northern and southern elephant seals were once hunted nearly to extinction. However, under legal protections both have made incredible comebacks.",

      "Para": "Celia lived in a haunted house, but it wasn't a scary haunted house. It was full of friendly and fun-loving ghosts. There was only one problem. Celia's parents could see the ghosts too, but they wouldn't admit it to Celia, and they had forbidden any of the ghosts to talk to her. Celia's parents had raised her not to believe in ghosts. They were teased growing up for their own ability to see them, and they wanted their daughter to have a normal life. So even though he had tried to talk to her parents about the ghosts, they especially about Buzz, who was her best friend, they refused to admit that they could see Buzz and the others, and they steadfastly maintained that the ghosts weren't real. But this didn't stop Celia, and Buzz from being friends. And Celia had another friend named Jeremy who could see Buzz too. One day Buzz had followed Celia to school. When she had seen all in front of the club there was a report. Buzz had stood up at the front of the class with her and done a silly dance job. While time she was speaking. Celia had barely been able to keep a straight face, and Jeremy hadn't been able to keep a straight face at all. He had covered his face with his hands, his shoulders shaking he had been laughing so hard. Celia had talked to Jeremy after school that day for the first time, and they'd been incapable ever since. One day after school, Jeremy took Celia to the old abandoned house on Quaker Street so that Jeremy could introduce her to his ghost friend, Larry. Larry tried to shake Celia's hand, but his hand passed right through hers. Celia put Larry empathetic with Larry's eyes. The Larry communicated with them about parents who made their lives too complicated by pretending to be what they were not, and by trying to do and do what they thought other people expected them to. Soon it began to get dark. \"We'd better go,\" Jeremy said. They said goodbye to Larry and started home. But they didn't make it all the way out of the house. As they were crossing the old, covered wooden front porch, the boards gave in between them and they fell down under the porch and were trapped. \"Help! Help!\" Celia called. But no one heard them. There were no neighbors. The house was at the very end of the dirt road that was at the very end of Quaker Street, so the nearest neighbors were half a mile away. \"What are we going to do?\" Celia said. \"I'll call Larry.\" Larry appeared, and Jeremy told him his plan. \"Go get Celia's ghost friend Buzz. Buzz can go to our parents and they'll come to help us.\" \"Can your parents see ghosts too?\" Celia asked. \"I'm really not sure,\" Jeremy said. \"But I guess we are going to find out!\" Larry did as Jeremy asked. Buzz was anxious to help. He went to Jeremy's house first, but Jeremy's parents really couldn't see him. Buzz was worried about the most-afide. There was no softening of the space in the room for him to slip through. It was like he was on the other side of an invisible wall. He went to Celia's house. Here the air felt familiar. It was squishy, and he could pop into the human world whenever he felt like it. He joined Celia's parents in the kitchen. They were grumpy. \"I don't see why every ghost in the neighborhood is here.\" That so congregate here.\" Celia's father said when he saw Buzz. Buzz told them what had happened. This is just a trick.\" Celia's father said. \"She's testing us again. She's trying to get us to admit that we can see Buzz 'stay alive' so should give up' then. Celia's mother says wearily. \"I can't keep this up.The lying is making me sick.\" Buzz goes back and tells Celia and Jeremy that he spoke to Celia's parents but they didn't believe him. \"But they saw you?\" Celia asked. \"Yes!\" Buzz says. \"They saw me!\" Another hour went by and Celia didn't come home for dinner. Her parents began to get frightened. \"Do you think it's true?\" her mother asked. \"Do you really think the kids are in trouble?\" \"I don't know,\" Celia's father said. \"But we need to go and find out.\" They hurried to the abandoned house on Quaker Street that Buzz had told them about. There, they found the children-scraped and bruised, but none the worse for wear-underneath the decrepit old porch. \"If you had been normal parents, or continued to pretend you were, then no one would have saved us,\" Celia told them. \"Yeah,\" Jeremy said. \"We could have starved.\" \"We're sorry,\" Celia's parents said. \"We just want you to have the best, and easiest. It's possible.\" \"My life with Buzz is the best life,\" Celia said. \"For one thing, Buzz probably saved my life!\" Then we're even.\" Buzz said. \"Because you've saved my afterlife from being lonely!\" Trademark * 2021 Energy S/C All rights reserved",

The house was at the very end of the dirt road that was at the very end of Quaker Street, so the nearest neighbors were half a mile away. \"What are we going to do?\" Celia said. \"I'll call Larry.\" Larry appeared, and Jeremy told him his plan. \"Go get Celia's ghost friend Buzz. Buzz can go to our parents and they'll come to help us.\" \"Can your parents see ghosts too?\" Celia asked. \"I'm really not sure,\" Jeremy said. \"But I guess we are going to find out!\" Larry did as Jeremy asked. Buzz was anxious to help. He went to Jeremy's house first, but Jeremy's parents really couldn't see him. Buzz was worried about the most-afide. There was no softening of the space in the room for him to slip through. It was like he was on the other side of an invisible wall. He went to Celia's house. Here the air felt familiar. It was squishy, and he could pop into the human world whenever he felt like it. He joined Celia's parents in the kitchen. They were grumpy. \"I don't see why every ghost in the neighborhood is here.\" That so congregate here.\" Celia's father said when he saw Buzz. Buzz told them what had happened.

Her parents began to get frightened. \"Do you think it's true?\" her mother asked. \"Do you really think the kids are in trouble?\" \"I don't know,\" Celia's father said. \"But we need to go and find out.\" They hurried to the abandoned house on Quaker Street that Buzz had told them about. There, they found the children-scraped and bruised, but none the worse for wear-underneath the decrepit old porch. \"If you had been normal parents, or continued to pretend you were, then no one would have saved us,\" Celia told them. \"Yeah,\" Jeremy said. \"We could have starved.\" \"We're sorry,\" Celia's parents said. \"We just want you to have the best, and easiest. It's possible.\" \"My life with Buzz is the best life,\" Celia said. \"For one thing, Buzz probably saved my life!\" Then we're even.\" Buzz said. \"Because you've saved my afterlife from being lonely!\" Trademark * 2021 Energy S/C All rights reserved",

Celia's parents could see the ghosts too, but they wouldn't admit it to Celia, and they had forbidden any of the ghosts to talk to her. Celia's parents had raised her not to believe in ghosts.

But this didn't stop Celia, and Buzz from being friends. And Celia had another friend named Jeremy who could see Buzz too. One day Buzz had followed Celia to school.

Buzz can go to our parents and they'll come to help us.\" \"Can your parents see ghosts too?\" Celia asked. \"I'm really not sure,\" Jeremy said. \"But I guess we are going to find out!\" Larry did as Jeremy asked. Buzz was anxious to help. He went to Jeremy's house first, but Jeremy's parents really couldn't see him. Buzz was worried about the most-afide. There was no softening of the space in the room for him to slip through. It was like he was on the other side of an invisible wall. He went to Celia's house. Here the air felt familiar. It was squishy, and he could pop into the human world whenever he felt like it. He joined Celia's parents in the kitchen. They were grumpy. \"I don't see why every ghost in the neighborhood is here.\" That so congregate here.\" Celia's father said when he saw Buzz. Buzz told them what had happened. This is just a trick.\" Celia's father said. \"She's testing us again. She's trying to get us to admit that we can see Buzz 'stay alive' so should give up' then. Celia's mother says wearily. \"I can't keep this up.The lying is making me sick.\" Buzz goes back and tells Celia and Jeremy that he spoke to Celia's parents but they didn't believe him. \"But they saw you?\" Celia asked. \"Yes!\" Buzz says. \"They saw me!\" Another hour went by and Celia didn't come home for dinner. Her parents began to get frightened. \"Do you think it's true?\" her mother asked. \"Do you really think the kids are in trouble?\" \"I don't know,\" Celia's father said. \"But we need to go and find out.\" They hurried to the abandoned house on Quaker Street that Buzz had told them about. There, they found the children-scraped and bruised, but none the worse for wear-underneath the decrepit old porch. \"If you had been normal parents, or continued to pretend you were, then no one would have saved us,\" Celia told them. \"Yeah,\" Jeremy said. \"We could have starved.\" \"We're sorry,\" Celia's parents said. \"We just want you to have the best, and easiest. It's possible.\" \"My life with Buzz is the best life,\" Celia said. \"For one thing, Buzz probably saved my life!\" Then we're even.\" Buzz said. \"Because you've saved my afterlife from being lonely!\" Trademark * 2021 Energy S/C All rights reserved",

       "Para": "Meerfus had been a wand-making magician for a long time. He had always done it all alone, ever since going off on his own. There was no one to help him organize his scrolls or sweep out his laboratory. It was a hard life that kept him busy, but it was like art, too. His work kept him very occupied, and people paid well for what he made. Still, as he got up there in years, he started looking for someone to train as an assistant. Now not just any goofy kid would do as an assistant. Magic did not come naturally to everyone, and even if it did, there were different kinds of magic. Many kids who started to realize they had magic were tempted to play pranks, goof around, and get in trouble. Some saw it as a way to get what they wanted — a power over common people. Meerfus needed someone good-natured and still talented magically. He had been traveling the countryside, looking for a specific kind of egg to use in one of the wands he was making. The current customer wanted a wand that would make his chickens lay colorful eggs, so he could charge more. It seemed silly, but eggs of different colors sold much better than white and brown ones. So, Meerfus was traveling around, looking for the right eggs to use. Meerfus was in a town, talking to a farmer who had a breed of ducks that laid bluish-green eggs, and he was trying to negotiate a deal for a few of them. Not only did Meerfus enjoy omelettes, but he did need an egg for the wand after all. This farmer smelled a sale and was trying to get as much money as possible for the eggs, when Meerfus noticed the man's son. The boy was all of six or seven years old, playing in the grass. That was not peculiar, nor was the fact that he was playing with a grasshopper. What was strange was the way the boy was using a twig to coax the grasshopper into performing acrobatics! Yes, the grasshopper was flipping and flopping as the boy giggled and teased it. \"Don't mind my boy, Duncan. He's got a strange mind and silliness about him.\" The farmer grunted. He wasn't impressed. \"Tell you what. I will give you one gold coin if you give me a dozen of your eggs, and then you send this boy to work for me when he turns ten.\" \"Duncan? You want my son? Whatever for?\" The farmer was amazed. \"Sir, I believe he is talented in the magical arts, and it is a talent I would like to see grown. I have need of an apprentice - an assistant. He will be fed, clothed, and taught, just as he would if he were to go work for a blacksmith or any other tradesman.\" \"My boy the magician.\" The farmer laughed and stuck out his hand. Meerfus shook the man's hand, left a gold coin in it, and walked over to introduce himself to Duncan. It was a short but important conversation. Meerfus showed the boy a trick with a wand of his own making, one that could make the grasshopper speak. When the boy's eyes lit up, he asked a very important question, one that told Meerfus he'd made the right choice: \"How can I learn to do that?\" Meerfus grinned at him. \"I'll teach you, but you need to wait a couple years.\" He left the promise and the wand of voices with the boy. True to his word, he'd come back three years later. The rest was history. Duncan was getting his lessons in magic from Meerfus the Magician, and one thing he was very curious about was the types of magic. He decided it was as good a time as any to ask. \"We can make wands, but why don't we make rings, magic swords, and potions?\" Duncan asked his master. Meerfus smiled at the question. Understanding one's limitations was very important, and a great lesson to learn. \"Well, we could make them, but with only limited success. Our success with wands is very high, but with rings and potions it might be one successful attempt in a handful of tries. That gets tiring to do.\" Duncan had a disappointed look on his face, and he needed to know the whole truth. \"But we could make a potion if we had to?\" \"Yes, but witches and warlocks are better at it. They aren't much good at wands, though Brooms, they do well at.\" Meerfus admitted, pulling at his beard. \"I don't much care about brooms, but magic swords that never get dull, or arrows that never miss their targets — those are very interesting to me.\" Duncan's eyes lit up. \"Ah, but you were born with talents in working natural materials. When I found you as a young lad, you were playing with a grasshopper and a twig you'd unknowingly worked some magic into. If you were meant to work metals, you'd have been using a spoon, a knife, or a fork to do it. You are naturally drawn to wands, and that is part of why I chose you as my student.\" \"I will never make a magic set of armor or a pair of flying shoes then.\" Duncan said with a sigh. Meerfus let out a great belly laugh. \"Magic armor is heavy and expensive, even if it's magical. It's better to have a wand that makes your skin as hard as steel for a short time. You don't have to worry about skin rusting! Flying shoes are just plain ridiculous. You'd fall over and crash. It's better to have a wand that gives you the ability to float or fall slowly. You can do the same thing with wands that you can do with any other piece of magic!\" \"I guess that's true, but those things impress people when they see them.\" Meerfus put a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"Duncan, you and I are not impressive. We're not particularly tall, strong, or even handsome, though I have a splendid beard.\" \"It's true.\" Duncan agreed. His master's beard was a source of pride, and quite handsome in fact. \"The thing is... wands are versatile, useful, and easy to carry. A set of armor or a great sword can do but one thing, but a man can carry a dozen wands. Sometimes, the unexpected comes from small, insignificant items.\" Duncan suddenly felt very proud of his profession. He was the one and only assistant to the best-known wand-making magician in the whole region! People came from far away to have Meerfus make them a wand, but he still had more questions. \"What about magic spells, the kind you don't need items to use? Why can't we just use words of power to shoot fireballs and freeze rivers?\" Meerfus chuckled. \"That, my boy, is an entirely different story. These are dangerous things, not to be played with, be happy with what you have and what you can do.\"",

He wasn't impressed. \"Tell you what. I will give you one gold coin if you give me a dozen of your eggs, and then you send this boy to work for me when he turns ten.\" \"Duncan? You want my son? Whatever for?\" The farmer was amazed. \"Sir, I believe he is talented in the magical arts, and it is a talent I would like to see grown. I have need of an apprentice - an assistant. He will be fed, clothed, and taught, just as he would if he were to go work for a blacksmith or any other tradesman.\" \"My boy the magician.\" The farmer laughed and stuck out his hand. Meerfus shook the man's hand, left a gold coin in it, and walked over to introduce himself to Duncan. It was a short but important conversation. Meerfus showed the boy a trick with a wand of his own making, one that could make the grasshopper speak. When the boy's eyes lit up, he asked a very important question, one that told Meerfus he'd made the right choice: \"How can I learn to do that?\" Meerfus grinned at him. \"I'll teach you, but you need to wait a couple years.\" He left the promise and the wand of voices with the boy. True to his word, he'd come back three years later. The rest was history. Duncan was getting his lessons in magic from Meerfus the Magician, and one thing he was very curious about was the types of magic. He decided it was as good a time as any to ask. \"We can make wands, but why don't we make rings, magic swords, and potions?\" Duncan asked his master. Meerfus smiled at the question. Understanding one's limitations was very important, and a great lesson to learn. \"Well, we could make them, but with only limited success. Our success with wands is very high, but with rings and potions it might be one successful attempt in a handful of tries. That gets tiring to do.\" Duncan had a disappointed look on his face, and he needed to know the whole truth. \"But we could make a potion if we had to?\" \"Yes, but witches and warlocks are better at it. They aren't much good at wands, though Brooms, they do well at.\" Meerfus admitted, pulling at his beard. \"I don't much care about brooms, but magic swords that never get dull, or arrows that never miss their targets — those are very interesting to me.\" Duncan's eyes lit up. \"Ah, but you were born with talents in working natural materials. When I found you as a young lad, you were playing with a grasshopper and a twig you'd unknowingly worked some magic into. If you were meant to work metals, you'd have been using a spoon, a knife, or a fork to do it. You are naturally drawn to wands, and that is part of why I chose you as my student.\" \"I will never make a magic set of armor or a pair of flying shoes then.\" Duncan said with a sigh. Meerfus let out a great belly laugh. \"Magic armor is heavy and expensive, even if it's magical. It's better to have a wand that makes your skin as hard as steel for a short time. You don't have to worry about skin rusting! Flying shoes are just plain ridiculous. You'd fall over and crash. It's better to have a wand that gives you the ability to float or fall slowly. You can do the same thing with wands that you can do with any other piece of magic!\" \"I guess that's true, but those things impress people when they see them.\" Meerfus put a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"Duncan, you and I are not impressive. We're not particularly tall, strong, or even handsome, though I have a splendid beard.\" \"It's true.\" Duncan agreed. His master's beard was a source of pride, and quite handsome in fact. \"The thing is... wands are versatile, useful, and easy to carry. A set of armor or a great sword can do but one thing, but a man can carry a dozen wands. Sometimes, the unexpected comes from small, insignificant items.\" Duncan suddenly felt very proud of his profession. He was the one and only assistant to the best-known wand-making magician in the whole region! People came from far away to have Meerfus make them a wand, but he still had more questions. \"What about magic spells, the kind you don't need items to use? Why can't we just use words of power to shoot fireballs and freeze rivers?\" Meerfus chuckled. \"That, my boy, is an entirely different story. These are dangerous things, not to be played with, be happy with what you have and what you can do.\"",

       "Para": "Meerfus had been a wand-making magician for a long time. He had always done it all alone, ever since going off on his own. There was no one to help him organize his scrolls or sweep out his laboratory. It was a hard life that kept him busy, but it was like art, too. His work kept him very occupied, and people paid well for what he made. Still, as he got up there in years, he started looking for someone to train as an assistant. Now not just any goofy kid would do as an assistant. Magic did not come naturally to everyone, and even if it did, there were different kinds of magic. Many kids who started to realize they had magic were tempted to play pranks, goof around, and get in trouble. Some saw it as a way to get what they wanted — a power over common people. Meerfus needed someone good-natured and still talented magically. He had been traveling the countryside, looking for a specific kind of egg to use in one of the wands he was making. The current customer wanted a wand that would make his chickens lay colorful eggs, so he could charge more. It seemed silly, but eggs of different colors sold much better than white and brown ones. So, Meerfus was traveling around, looking for the right eggs to use. Meerfus was in a town, talking to a farmer who had a breed of ducks that laid bluish-green eggs, and he was trying to negotiate a deal for a few of them. Not only did Meerfus enjoy omelettes, but he did need an egg for the wand after all. This farmer smelled a sale and was trying to get as much money as possible for the eggs, when Meerfus noticed the man's son. The boy was all of six or seven years old, playing in the grass. That was not peculiar, nor was the fact that he was playing with a grasshopper. What was strange was the way the boy was using a twig to coax the grasshopper into performing acrobatics!

There was no one to help him organize his scrolls or sweep out his laboratory. It was a hard life that kept him busy, but it was like art, too. His work kept him very occupied, and people paid well for what he made. Still, as he got up there in years, he started looking for someone to train as an assistant. Now not just any goofy kid would do as an assistant. Magic did not come naturally to everyone, and even if it did, there were different kinds of magic. Many kids who started to realize they had magic were tempted to play pranks, goof around, and get in trouble. Some saw it as a way to get what they wanted — a power over common people. Meerfus needed someone good-natured and still talented magically. He had been traveling the countryside, looking for a specific kind of egg to use in one of the wands he was making. The current customer wanted a wand that would make his chickens lay colorful eggs, so he could charge more. It seemed silly, but eggs of different colors sold much better than white and brown ones. So, Meerfus was traveling around, looking for the right eggs to use. Meerfus was in a town, talking to a farmer who had a breed of ducks that laid bluish-green eggs, and he was trying to negotiate a deal for a few of them. Not only did Meerfus enjoy omelettes, but he did need an egg for the wand after all. This farmer smelled a sale and was trying to get as much money as possible for the eggs, when Meerfus noticed the man's son. The boy was all of six or seven years old, playing in the grass. That was not peculiar, nor was the fact that he was playing with a grasshopper. What was strange was the way the boy was using a twig to coax the grasshopper into performing acrobatics! Yes, the grasshopper was flipping and flopping as the boy giggled and teased it. \"Don't mind my boy, Duncan. He's got a strange mind and silliness about him.\" The farmer grunted. He wasn't impressed. \"Tell you what. I will give you one gold coin if you give me a dozen of your eggs, and then you send this boy to work for me when he turns ten.\" \"Duncan? You want my son? Whatever for?\" The farmer was amazed. \"Sir, I believe he is talented in the magical arts, and it is a talent I would like to see grown. I have need of an apprentice - an assistant. He will be fed, clothed, and taught, just as he would if he were to go work for a blacksmith or any other tradesman.\" \"My boy the magician.\" The farmer laughed and stuck out his hand. Meerfus shook the man's hand, left a gold coin in it, and walked over to introduce himself to Duncan. It was a short but important conversation. Meerfus showed the boy a trick with a wand of his own making, one that could make the grasshopper speak. When the boy's eyes lit up, he asked a very important question, one that told Meerfus he'd made the right choice: \"How can I learn to do that?\" Meerfus grinned at him. \"I'll teach you, but you need to wait a couple years.\" He left the promise and the wand of voices with the boy. True to his word, he'd come back three years later. The rest was history. Duncan was getting his lessons in magic from Meerfus the Magician, and one thing he was very curious about was the types of magic. He decided it was as good a time as any to ask. \"We can make wands, but why don't we make rings, magic swords, and potions?\" Duncan asked his master. Meerfus smiled at the question. Understanding one's limitations was very important, and a great lesson to learn. \"Well, we could make them, but with only limited success. Our success with wands is very high, but with rings and potions it might be one successful attempt in a handful of tries. That gets tiring to do.\" Duncan had a disappointed look on his face, and he needed to know the whole truth. \"But we could make a potion if we had to?\" \"Yes, but witches and warlocks are better at it. They aren't much good at wands, though Brooms, they do well at.\" Meerfus admitted, pulling at his beard. \"I don't much care about brooms, but magic swords that never get dull, or arrows that never miss their targets — those are very interesting to me.\" Duncan's eyes lit up. \"Ah, but you were born with talents in working natural materials. When I found you as a young lad, you were playing with a grasshopper and a twig you'd unknowingly worked some magic into. If you were meant to work metals, you'd have been using a spoon, a knife, or a fork to do it. You are naturally drawn to wands, and that is part of why I chose you as my student.\" \"I will never make a magic set of armor or a pair of flying shoes then.\" Duncan said with a sigh. Meerfus let out a great belly laugh. \"Magic armor is heavy and expensive, even if it's magical. It's better to have a wand that makes your skin as hard as steel for a short time. You don't have to worry about skin rusting! Flying shoes are just plain ridiculous. You'd fall over and crash. It's better to have a wand that gives you the ability to float or fall slowly. You can do the same thing with wands that you can do with any other piece of magic!\" \"I guess that's true, but those things impress people when they see them.\" Meerfus put a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"Duncan, you and I are not impressive. We're not particularly tall, strong, or even handsome, though I have a splendid beard.\" \"It's true.\" Duncan agreed. His master's beard was a source of pride, and quite handsome in fact. \"The thing is... wands are versatile, useful, and easy to carry. A set of armor or a great sword can do but one thing, but a man can carry a dozen wands. Sometimes, the unexpected comes from small, insignificant items.\" Duncan suddenly felt very proud of his profession. He was the one and only assistant to the best-known wand-making magician in the whole region! People came from far away to have Meerfus make them a wand, but he still had more questions. \"What about magic spells, the kind you don't need items to use? Why can't we just use words of power to shoot fireballs and freeze rivers?\" Meerfus chuckled. \"That, my boy, is an entirely different story. These are dangerous things, not to be played with, be happy with what you have and what you can do.\"",

      "Para": "Meerfus the Magician had a rival in the wand-making business. Yes, he was probably the most famous wand-maker in the land, a magician of great renown, but he did have a rival: Milton. Milton was a strange fellow, a magician in his own right, but really more of a mischief-maker and a wacky inventor. Milton's most famous invention was an Amphibious Assault War Vessel. This was a fancy name for a rowboat with two axles on the bottom and wheels. If the conditions were right, the people rowing the boat could catch enough wind in a sail and row fast enough that when they hit the land, they could keep going. The boat would just roll up on shore and the special oars could be used to keep moving along the land. Milton's normal crew consisted of goblins, which made poor rowers in the best of conditions. They often got stuck in the muck and sand at the edge of lakes and had to drag the boat out with ropes. Still, they did tend to strike terror in the small townsfolk, which allowed Milton to collect wand-making materials without much challenge. Milton made lots of wands, often from cheaper materials. Many of his wands were used for mischief. He didn't spend the time and effort to get high-end materials, but he sold a lot of wands. Unfortunately, many of his wands would not last long or would not work exactly as planned. You got what you paid for in magic and just about everything else. Meerfus and Milton had a strong rivalry over their territory. They both wanted to sell wands, but Milton's mobility as a traveling salesman meant that he reached more customers. Meerfus, on the other hand, relied on word of mouth. Many of his customers travelled to see him, because of positive reviews from other customers he had. Reputation was very important. In addition to that, Meerfus' helper apprentice, Duncan, was fairly useful. He was beginning to learn the trade, and could generally follow orders without bungling them. Milton's team of green goblins was pretty useless. It was a good thing there were lots of them, because terrible accidents often befell them when collecting Milton's supplies. It was rather sad really. Finally, Meerfus liked to fancy himself as being a bit more handsome than his rival. Milton had scabby skin, mostly on account of poor hygiene and associating with goblins. Goblins were known to carry ticks and all manners of diseases. Milton was also having a patchy beard. Meerfus had a rather magnificent beard himself, and was known to be complimented for it on a regular basis. It was curly, soft, and tied off with colourful strings or decorations to fit the holidays and seasons. This was not to mention that he was a snappy dresser, unlike Milton, who wore threadbare, stained rags for the most part. Truly, Meerfus was the superior wizard in matters of fashion, appearance, skills, and professionalism!",

      "Para": "Meerfus the Magician had a rival in the wand-making business. Yes, he was probably the most famous wand-maker in the land, a magician of great renown, but he did have a rival: Milton. Milton was a strange fellow, a magician in his own right, but really more of a mischief-maker and a wacky inventor. Milton's most famous invention was an Amphibious Assault War Vessel. This was a fancy name for a rowboat with two axles on the bottom and wheels. If the conditions were right, the people rowing the boat could catch enough wind in a sail and row fast enough that when they hit the land, they could keep going. The boat would just roll up on shore and the special oars could be used to keep moving along the land. Milton's normal crew consisted of goblins, which made poor rowers in the best of conditions. They often got stuck in the muck and sand at the edge of lakes and had to drag the boat out with ropes. Still, they did tend to strike terror in the small townsfolk, which allowed Milton to collect wand-making materials without much challenge. Milton made lots of wands, often from cheaper materials. Many of his wands were used for mischief. He didn't spend the time and effort to get high-end materials, but he sold a lot of wands. Unfortunately, many of his wands would not last long or would not work exactly as planned. You got what you paid for in magic and just about everything else. Meerfus and Milton had a strong rivalry over their territory. They both wanted to sell wands, but Milton's mobility as a traveling salesman meant that he reached more customers. Meerfus, on the other hand, relied on word of mouth. Many of his customers travelled to see him, because of positive reviews from other customers he had. Reputation was very important. In addition to that, Meerfus' helper apprentice, Duncan, was fairly useful. He was beginning to learn the trade, and could generally follow orders without bungling them. Milton's team of green goblins was pretty useless. It was a good thing there were lots of them, because terrible accidents often befell them when collecting Milton's supplies. It was rather sad really. Finally, Meerfus liked to fancy himself as being a bit more handsome than his rival. Milton had scabby skin, mostly on account of poor hygiene and associating with goblins. Goblins were known to carry ticks and all manners of diseases. Milton was also having a patchy beard. Meerfus had a rather magnificent beard himself, and was known to be complimented for it on a regular basis. It was curly, soft, and tied off with colourful strings or decorations to fit the holidays and seasons. This was not to mention that he was a snappy dresser, unlike Milton, who wore threadbare, stained rags for the most part. Truly, Meerfus was the superior wizard in matters of fashion, appearance, skills, and professionalism!",

      "Para": "What Australian mammal can leap 25 feet in one hop and move at 35 miles an hour? The red kangaroo. A grown male stands as tall as a six-foot person and weighs 200 pounds. This is slightly bigger than the grey kangaroo, making it the world's largest marsupial. What is a marsupial? A mammal where the mother has a pouch for carrying, feeding, and protecting her young. While a red kangaroo may be the largest marsupial, the newborn baby is tiny, under an inch long. After a few months of sleeping, nursing, and growing in its mother's pouch, the young kangaroo (joey) begins to come out. But it hops back to the pouch if threatened or cold. Eventually, the joey gets too big and hangs out of the pouch. At eight months old, it stays out but remains close to mom until ready to live on its own. Red kangaroos are good swimmers. However, they are best known for their hopping abilities. Their long, powerful hind legs have big feet. Hopping moves them quickly over their grassy, shrubby, and desert habitats. Meanwhile, a thick tail helps them balance and steer. What do red kangaroos eat? Grass, leaves, and other vegetation. They often regurgitate and re-chew their food, just like a cow. The red kangaroo's vegetation diet provides much of its water. It can also go long periods without drinking. Staying in the shade, panting, and limiting most activity to nighttime helps the red kangaroo conserve water and stay cool. Red kangaroos travel together in groups called mobs. Mobs include both males and females, with one male being dominant. Males show their dominance by 'boxing' with other males. They balance on their tails and try pushing each other off balance with their forearms or by kicking their hind legs. This fighting ability, along with their sharp claws, can also be used by kangaroos to defend against Australia's wild dog, the dingo.",

      "Para": "Derek was an orphan. When the plane he was in crashed in the middle of nowhere and he was the only survivor, he was lucky to be found by a community of people living in isolation. The world he came from was aggressive and bleak, but life in the wilderness community was fair and good, and his family was grateful to be found. He began to grow close to one particular family, and he wanted to stay with them forever. For the first time in his life, he had parents, a brother and a sister. But the world that Derek came from did not like this isolated community and they would do anything to find and destroy it. And the people in the community lived in fear, they allowed him to stay out at sight of passing aircraft. But after Derek's arrival it seemed like there were helicopters and planes circling overhead every day. Derek didn't want to leave, but he didn't want to endanger the family that he loved. So, he made up his mind. He would leave the community. He would allow one of the searching aircraft to find him and take him home. It was the only way he could think of to keep the community safe. Derek left a note for his new \"father\" John Brown, and set off at sunset. He felt sad and lonely, but determined. He wished he'd brought along one of the dogs for company. One of them had taken a particular liking to him. But he knew that taking the dog would have been stealing from the community, and he didn't want to steal anything from the people that had saved his life and given him so much. When John Brown found the note, he read it out loud to his family. Then he set it down with a heavy heart. His daughter, Paula, ran out of the room. She ran directly toward the kennel and let out Tracker, the dog that had grown so attached to Derek during his stay. She let Tracker smell a shirt that Derek had worn and left behind. \"Find Derek,\" she said. Then Michael followed her. They set off, the dog bounding ahead every so often to sniff around and to let the panting children catch up. Soon they saw Derek up ahead in the fading light. Then they heard and saw the helicopter. Tracker ran, yelping, towards Derek as the helicopter dropped lower. Someone stood in its doorway and Tracker began growling and barking at him. The man had a gun and he lowered it, preparing to shoot the dog. When Derek saw that, he ran out and grabbed the rope ladder from the helicopter and pulled down with all of his might. It rocked enough to send the shot into the trees and miss the dog. Tracker ran up to Derek. Paula, frightened now, hung back. \"The dog won't hurt you, come alone and I'll come with you,\" Derek called to the man with the gun. \"He's a stray.\" The man pulled Derek up into the helicopter, which lifted swiftly off the ground, leaving Tracker yelping after them in a storm of dust and leaves. \"You the boy from the plane wreck?\" the pilot asked Derek. \"Yes,\" he said. Derek told them he had been alone in the woods the past month. They asked him if he had run into any people and he told them no. As they took off, he saw Paula and Michael hiding in the bushes, wide eyed as they watched Derek fly away. He didn't acknowledge them, because he didn't want to call attention to them. As the helicopter lifted up and disappeared over the trees, the dog was howling. After that, the men ignored him. Derek was heartbroken. He didn't want to go back. The only way he could stay in the community, he knew, was if the people where he came from thought he was dead. He gazed out the window. The helicopter was not flying too high, and Derek realized that they were looking around for the community. Derek's heart began to pound. As they approached the lake, he suddenly had an idea. He remembered that the centre of the lake was abnormally deep. They got closer and closer and suddenly Derek knew there was no more time to think about it. Derek thought of Michael and Paula and John Brown, of Tracker, and of the freedom he had had for the past month that was more precious than anything that he had ever known and he jumped. The fall was so fast that it sucked the breath right out of him. He made himself into a ball and plunged into the water, still falling, deeper, and deeper, knowing he didn't dare come back up. He plunged down and down and down, and then began to swim. He had to get as far away from the scene as he could before he was forced to come up for air. The men in the helicopter looked down after him, and began to circle the lake. Minutes passed, and still, they didn't see Derek's body surface. \"Should we go down after him? That's a lot of money that just fell out of here.\" \"No,\" the pilot said. He banked the helicopter and they flew away from the lake, over the mountains, and out of sight. At the far end of the lakeshore, Derek was hiding in the bushes, his heart pounding. When he saw the helicopter turn and disappear, he breathed a sigh of relief. He stood up, and was greeted with a yelp from Tracker and a call from Michael. \"Derek!\" Paula flew at him from out of the woods and clung to him. \"Derek! That was the bravest thing I ever saw!\" \"Come on,\" Michael said. \"We'd better get you home.\"",

It rocked enough to send the shot into the trees and miss the dog. Tracker ran up to Derek. Paula, frightened now, hung back. \"The dog won't hurt you, come alone and I'll come with you,\" Derek called to the man with the gun. \"He's a stray.\" The man pulled Derek up into the helicopter, which lifted swiftly off the ground, leaving Tracker yelping after them in a storm of dust and leaves. \"You the boy from the plane wreck?\" the pilot asked Derek. \"Yes,\" he said. Derek told them he had been alone in the woods the past month. They asked him if he had run into any people and he told them no. As they took off, he saw Paula and Michael hiding in the bushes, wide eyed as they watched Derek fly away. He didn't acknowledge them, because he didn't want to call attention to them. As the helicopter lifted up and disappeared over the trees, the dog was howling. After that, the men ignored him. Derek was heartbroken. He didn't want to go back. The only way he could stay in the community, he knew, was if the people where he came from thought he was dead. He gazed out the window. The helicopter was not flying too high, and Derek realized that they were looking around for the community. Derek's heart began to pound. As they approached the lake, he suddenly had an idea. He remembered that the centre of the lake was abnormally deep. They got closer and closer and suddenly Derek knew there was no more time to think about it. Derek thought of Michael and Paula and John Brown, of Tracker, and of the freedom he had had for the past month that was more precious than anything that he had ever known and he jumped. The fall was so fast that it sucked the breath right out of him. He made himself into a ball and plunged into the water, still falling, deeper, and deeper, knowing he didn't dare come back up. He plunged down and down and down, and then began to swim. He had to get as far away from the scene as he could before he was forced to come up for air. The men in the helicopter looked down after him, and began to circle the lake. Minutes passed, and still, they didn't see Derek's body surface. \"Should we go down after him? That's a lot of money that just fell out of here.\" \"No,\" the pilot said. He banked the helicopter and they flew away from the lake, over the mountains, and out of sight. At the far end of the lakeshore, Derek was hiding in the bushes, his heart pounding. When he saw the helicopter turn and disappear, he breathed a sigh of relief. He stood up, and was greeted with a yelp from Tracker and a call from Michael. \"Derek!\" Paula flew at him from out of the woods and clung to him. \"Derek! That was the bravest thing I ever saw!\" \"Come on,\" Michael said. \"We'd better get you home.\"",

      "Para": "Derek was an orphan. When the plane he was in crashed in the middle of nowhere and he was the only survivor, he was lucky to be found by a community of people living in isolation. The world he came from was aggressive and bleak, but life in the wilderness community was fair and good, and his family was grateful to be found. He began to grow close to one particular family, and he wanted to stay with them forever. For the first time in his life, he had parents, a brother and a sister. But the world that Derek came from did not like this isolated community and they would do anything to find and destroy it. And the people in the community lived in fear, they allowed him to stay out at sight of passing aircraft. But after Derek's arrival it seemed like there were helicopters and planes circling overhead every day. Derek didn't want to leave, but he didn't want to endanger the family that he loved. So, he made up his mind. He would leave the community. He would allow one of the searching aircraft to find him and take him home. It was the only way he could think of to keep the community safe. Derek left a note for his new \"father\" John Brown, and set off at sunset. He felt sad and lonely, but determined. He wished he'd brought along one of the dogs for company. One of them had taken a particular liking to him. But he knew that taking the dog would have been stealing from the community, and he didn't want to steal anything from the people that had saved his life and given him so much. When John Brown found the note, he read it out loud to his family. Then he set it down with a heavy heart. His daughter, Paula, ran out of the room. She ran directly toward the kennel and let out Tracker, the dog that had grown so attached to Derek during his stay. She let Tracker smell a shirt that Derek had worn and left behind. \"Find Derek,\" she said. Then Michael followed her. They set off, the dog bounding ahead every so often to sniff around and to let the panting children catch up. Soon they saw Derek up ahead in the fading light. Then they heard and saw the helicopter.

She ran directly toward the kennel and let out Tracker, the dog that had grown so attached to Derek during his stay. She let Tracker smell a shirt that Derek had worn and left behind. \"Find Derek,\" she said. Then Michael followed her. They set off, the dog bounding ahead every so often to sniff around and to let the panting children catch up. Soon they saw Derek up ahead in the fading light. Then they heard and saw the helicopter. Tracker ran, yelping, towards Derek as the helicopter dropped lower. Someone stood in its doorway and Tracker began growling and barking at him. The man had a gun and he lowered it, preparing to shoot the dog. When Derek saw that, he ran out and grabbed the rope ladder from the helicopter and pulled down with all of his might. It rocked enough to send the shot into the trees and miss the dog. Tracker ran up to Derek. Paula, frightened now, hung back. \"The dog won't hurt you, come alone and I'll come with you,\" Derek called to the man with the gun. \"He's a stray.\" The man pulled Derek up into the helicopter, which lifted swiftly off the ground, leaving Tracker yelping after them in a storm of dust and leaves. \"You the boy from the plane wreck?\" the pilot asked Derek. \"Yes,\" he said. Derek told them he had been alone in the woods the past month. They asked him if he had run into any people and he told them no. As they took off, he saw Paula and Michael hiding in the bushes, wide eyed as they watched Derek fly away. He didn't acknowledge them, because he didn't want to call attention to them. As the helicopter lifted up and disappeared over the trees, the dog was howling. After that, the men ignored him. Derek was heartbroken. He didn't want to go back. The only way he could stay in the community, he knew, was if the people where he came from thought he was dead. He gazed out the window. The helicopter was not flying too high, and Derek realized that they were looking around for the community. Derek's heart began to pound. As they approached the lake, he suddenly had an idea. He remembered that the centre of the lake was abnormally deep. They got closer and closer and suddenly Derek knew there was no more time to think about it. Derek thought of Michael and Paula and John Brown, of Tracker, and of the freedom he had had for the past month that was more precious than anything that he had ever known and he jumped. The fall was so fast that it sucked the breath right out of him. He made himself into a ball and plunged into the water, still falling, deeper, and deeper, knowing he didn't dare come back up. He plunged down and down and down, and then began to swim. He had to get as far away from the scene as he could before he was forced to come up for air. The men in the helicopter looked down after him, and began to circle the lake. Minutes passed, and still, they didn't see Derek's body surface. \"Should we go down after him? That's a lot of money that just fell out of here.\" \"No,\" the pilot said. He banked the helicopter and they flew away from the lake, over the mountains, and out of sight. At the far end of the lakeshore, Derek was hiding in the bushes, his heart pounding. When he saw the helicopter turn and disappear, he breathed a sigh of relief. He stood up, and was greeted with a yelp from Tracker and a call from Michael. \"Derek!\" Paula flew at him from out of the woods and clung to him. \"Derek! That was the bravest thing I ever saw!\" \"Come on,\" Michael said. \"We'd better get you home.\"",

Will there be witches and wizards?\" Duncan asked as they rode on the back of a wagon. Normally, they walked nearly everywhere, but Meerfus had a large chest and a few bags stuffed with the best of their wands to sell and show off. Meerfus smiled and dangled his legs off the back of the wagon. \"Yes, yes, all the best potion-mixers, spell-wielders, and magic-makers will be there. Witches, warlocks, mage smiths, magicians, druids, and all the like will attend.\" Duncan shook his head, trying to imagine it. \"So, we will meet other magicians like us?\" \"Milton the Green is certain to be there.\" Meerfus sniffed in dislike, as if mentioning his rival – at least in terms of sales region if not talent – bothered him. Duncan wrinkled his nose. Milton the Green was a cranky old man with poor hygiene. He had a team of goblins that rowed him around in a sailboat on wheels. It was a very strange sight. He made cheap wands that hardly worked, but people liked the price. \"Why do people go to this council though?\" Meerfus nodded in approval at the question. It was a good one. \"Even magicians like myself can learn things from seeing other masters of our trade. There are several excellent wand-makers that I like to compete with and get ideas from. Elton the Brown, Mimi the Chartreuse, Kalon the Black...\" He smiled fondly at the idea of meeting with his peers and sharing ideas. \"Why do wand-makers all take color names?\" \"Well, we just take to a color, and it becomes our trademark. Witches all wear black, so they get known for the type of potion they are best making - love potions, healing potions, or whatnot. Wizards usually take names from natural things that sound imposing, such as Lightning Bolt Lewis, Granite Gerard, Stormcloud Sara, and Hurricane Hurbold. They are more of a quarrelsome bunch though, and they tend to fight in a lot of duels with magic. It is best to steer clear of them.\" Duncan grinned. He couldn't believe it. Finally, they were getting to go off and do something exciting. Instead of just learning about making wands and making a few here and there, they would rub elbows with the most powerful wizards in the fields. They would come from all over, and take notice of each other's greatest accomplishments. \"There will be other apprentices there to meet, too. I know a mage-smith's apprentice named David, that you might like to spend time with. His master is a great maker of magic rings and blades. You will probably make good friends, of course, there will be dozens of other apprentices and assistants to meet and have fun with, too. Just don't drink anything a witch's apprentice makes you. You can never tell what those girls mix in a drink! You might even turn into a toad... for a day or two.\" Duncan shivered, and it wasn't just the bumpy wagon. He didn't like the idea of turning into an amphibian one bit, even if it was only temporary. \"Oh, Duncan, there will be much to see and learn for both of us. I will have to sit in many boring discussions of new rules and limitations on the sales and manufacturing of items, while you'll be free to run the streets and meet young magicians of all sorts! I wish I could be young again. If only for a week.\" Meerfus sighed. \"You are still young enough to play some, master. Besides, it sounds like you have many friends there.

Elton the Brown, Mimi the Chartreuse, Kalon the Black...\" He smiled fondly at the idea of meeting with his peers and sharing ideas. \"Why do wand-makers all take color names?\" \"Well, we just take to a color, and it becomes our trademark. Witches all wear black, so they get known for the type of potion they are best making - love potions, healing potions, or whatnot. Wizards usually take names from natural things that sound imposing, such as Lightning Bolt Lewis, Granite Gerard, Stormcloud Sara, and Hurricane Hurbold. They are more of a quarrelsome bunch though, and they tend to fight in a lot of duels with magic. It is best to steer clear of them.\" Duncan grinned. He couldn't believe it. Finally, they were getting to go off and do something exciting. Instead of just learning about making wands and making a few here and there, they would rub elbows with the most powerful wizards in the fields. They would come from all over, and take notice of each other's greatest accomplishments. \"There will be other apprentices there to meet, too. I know a mage-smith's apprentice named David, that you might like to spend time with. His master is a great maker of magic rings and blades. You will probably make good friends, of course, there will be dozens of other apprentices and assistants to meet and have fun with, too. Just don't drink anything a witch's apprentice makes you. You can never tell what those girls mix in a drink! You might even turn into a toad... for a day or two.\" Duncan shivered, and it wasn't just the bumpy wagon. He didn't like the idea of turning into an amphibian one bit, even if it was only temporary. \"Oh, Duncan, there will be much to see and learn for both of us. I will have to sit in many boring discussions of new rules and limitations on the sales and manufacturing of items, while you'll be free to run the streets and meet young magicians of all sorts! I wish I could be young again. If only for a week.\" Meerfus sighed. \"You are still young enough to play some, master. Besides, it sounds like you have many friends there.

     "Para": "Duncan was getting ready to make another wand. His master, Meerfus, was letting him try more and more often these days. Duncan had been working with the famous wand-making magician for more than three years and that he was getting to an age when he needed to be able to make some of his own wands. It was part of the learning process. Sadly, Duncan didn't always succeed when he tried to make wands. Meerfus claimed it was all in his focus. But he'd wonder, what was the thinking when he was trying to make the wands? Apparently, he had to focus completely on the goal at hand, and could not allow himself distraction. Distractions made for bad wands, and he was still not able to focus all of his thoughts on the task of making wands. He always had things he was wondering about or things that diverted his attention. For example, when he was making a wand that was supposed to sweep bugs out of a house, he was also thinking about the dairy man who was delivering milk down the road at that moment. So, instead of just sweeping away bugs, the wand produced bugs with little mustaches of milk. This was a pretty silly result and the bugs smelled awful after a few days. Another time, Duncan's wand for sweeping floors ended up making dust devils that acted like mini tornadoes. The dust devils raged around the house, all because he'd been staring out the window at a swirl of leaves that had been caught up in winds against the locals. He realized he really needed to focus or Meerfus was bound to get upset. The mini tornadoes had really messed up Meerfus' scrolls and papers, and it had taken nearly a week to sort them back out. Meerfus decided that Duncan needed to work without distraction so they'd built a curtain that surrounded his whole work table to help him figure out how to ignore things around him. The white sheet hung on all four sides of him as he worked now. Meerfus always said it was not the materials that Duncan chose that caused problems, because Duncan chose those well. So, if it was entirely the fault of his focus, he really had no excuse now, did he? Duncan looked at the materials on his worktable. He was making a fire-starting wand. The ingredients for that particular wand were woven over the long splinter of dried pine, bits of iron, and flecks of flint and steel for creating sparks. Duncan wore gloves and handled the coals with ease, because they were hot enough to burn. He laid out the ingredients carefully, cleared his mind, and spoke the words that came to mind, words that helped focus its natural magic into the wand he was making. \"Flame Start East Wind.\" The wand flared up a glowing red aspect, as if he'd just blown on the coals to make them glow. The length of the wand glittered dangerously with flint and steel chips. It seemed as if he'd succeeded, so he took the gloves off and went out to his waiting master with his new wand in hand. Meerfus grinned and nodded toward the fireplace, where a few logs sat ready to be lit. All other flammable materials had been moved back from the fireplace at least three or four steps. Duncan shook his wrist and pointed the wand at the fireplace. There was no huge explosion; there was no blast of smoke and ash, and there were no strange side effects; just a simple, warm fire started around the logs, burning cheerfully. \"Good work, Duncan!\" Meerfus clapped happily. \"You shall leave us still here. I need not keep the money for it - minus the cost of materials, which was next to nothing!\" Duncan grinned sheepishly. He didn't know what to say, but it seemed sad to sell the wand. \"Can I keep it as my first successful wand, after all?\" Meerfus nodded. \"This is fine, perhaps better than selling it.

     "Para": "Duncan was getting ready to make another wand. His master, Meerfus, was letting him try more and more often these days. Duncan had been working with the famous wand-making magician for more than three years and that he was getting to an age when he needed to be able to make some of his own wands. It was part of the learning process. Sadly, Duncan didn't always succeed when he tried to make wands. Meerfus claimed it was all in his focus. But he'd wonder, what was the thinking when he was trying to make the wands? Apparently, he had to focus completely on the goal at hand, and could not allow himself distraction. Distractions made for bad wands, and he was still not able to focus all of his thoughts on the task of making wands. He always had things he was wondering about or things that diverted his attention. For example, when he was making a wand that was supposed to sweep bugs out of a house, he was also thinking about the dairy man who was delivering milk down the road at that moment. So, instead of just sweeping away bugs, the wand produced bugs with little mustaches of milk. This was a pretty silly result and the bugs smelled awful after a few days. Another time, Duncan's wand for sweeping floors ended up making dust devils that acted like mini tornadoes. The dust devils raged around the house, all because he'd been staring out the window at a swirl of leaves that had been caught up in winds against the locals. He realized he really needed to focus or Meerfus was bound to get upset. The mini tornadoes had really messed up Meerfus' scrolls and papers, and it had taken nearly a week to sort them back out. Meerfus decided that Duncan needed to work without distraction so they'd built a curtain that surrounded his whole work table to help him figure out how to ignore things around him. The white sheet hung on all four sides of him as he worked now. Meerfus always said it was not the materials that Duncan chose that caused problems, because Duncan chose those well. So, if it was entirely the fault of his focus, he really had no excuse now, did he? Duncan looked at the materials on his worktable. He was making a fire-starting wand. The ingredients for that particular wand were woven over the long splinter of dried pine, bits of iron, and flecks of flint and steel for creating sparks. Duncan wore gloves and handled the coals with ease, because they were hot enough to burn. He laid out the ingredients carefully, cleared his mind, and spoke the words that came to mind, words that helped focus its natural magic into the wand he was making. \"Flame Start East Wind.\" The wand flared up a glowing red aspect, as if he'd just blown on the coals to make them glow. The length of the wand glittered dangerously with flint and steel chips. It seemed as if he'd succeeded, so he took the gloves off and went out to his waiting master with his new wand in hand. Meerfus grinned and nodded toward the fireplace, where a few logs sat ready to be lit. All other flammable materials had been moved back from the fireplace at least three or four steps. Duncan shook his wrist and pointed the wand at the fireplace. There was no huge explosion; there was no blast of smoke and ash, and there were no strange side effects; just a simple, warm fire started around the logs, burning cheerfully. \"Good work, Duncan!\" Meerfus clapped happily. \"You shall leave us still here. I need not keep the money for it - minus the cost of materials, which was next to nothing!\" Duncan grinned sheepishly. He didn't know what to say, but it seemed sad to sell the wand. \"Can I keep it as my first successful wand, after all?\" Meerfus nodded. \"This is fine, perhaps better than selling it. Make another tomorrow now and sell that one instead.\"",

Massive explosions are going on all of the time inside the Sun. It's what makes the light every day and keeps our planet warm. Light travels from the Sun to us in about eight minutes. The Sun is the most massive thing in our solar system. It is so big you could fit about a million Earths inside of it. Closest to the Sun is the planet Mercury. You could squeeze about 18 Mercurys into Earth. Mercury's surface is rocky, but it has a huge iron core and it generates a big magnetic field. Speedy little Mercury zips around the sun in only eighty-eight days. Mercury was the messenger of the gods in Roman mythology, known for his speed. Second in line comes Venus, which is sometimes called Earth's twin. It's about the same size as Earth, but that's where the similarities end. Venus is always covered in thick clouds full of sulfuric acid. They whip around the planet at more than two hundred twenty miles per hour. Venus' winds sheet sand made of silicate around Venus' very dry, gold surface. The temperature averages nine hundred degrees, and the pressure is ninety times that on Earth. It takes two hundred twenty-four days to orbit the sun. Like Mercury, Venus was also named after a Roman Goddess, the Goddess of love. You know what planet is next. You live on it. Yup, the Earth is number three. We have a rocky iron core at the center of our planet. We have liquid water, and our air is made of mostly nitrogen and oxygen. It takes three hundred sixty-five days for us to circle the sun. We only have one moon. Next is Mars. Mars also has a core of rocks and iron. It is a little more than half the size of Earth. The most distinct feature about Mars is its red color. Out of the iron oxide covers the planet. It's as if the planet is rusting. White caps at the poles are water, forever frozen because of the colder temperatures further from the Sun. The only place the temperature rises above freezing is at the equator, or the middle of the planet. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos but they are much smaller than our own moon. It takes nearly twice as long for Mars to circle the sun at almost 687 days. The last part of the inner solar system is called the Asteroid Belt. It's the line between the inner rocky planets and the outer gas giant planets. Unlike the rest of the Inner Solar System, the Asteroid Belt isn't a planet at all. It is a bunch of large rocky chunks, mostly meteoroids. There is a dwarf planet named Ceres in the asteroid belt. The rest aren't very large.

Venus is always covered in thick clouds full of sulfuric acid. They whip around the planet at more than two hundred twenty miles per hour. Venus' winds sheet sand made of silicate around Venus' very dry, gold surface. The temperature averages nine hundred degrees, and the pressure is ninety times that on Earth. It takes two hundred twenty-four days to orbit the sun. Like Mercury, Venus was also named after a Roman Goddess, the Goddess of love. You know what planet is next. You live on it. Yup, the Earth is number three. We have a rocky iron core at the center of our planet. We have liquid water, and our air is made of mostly nitrogen and oxygen. It takes three hundred sixty-five days for us to circle the sun. We only have one moon. Next is Mars. Mars also has a core of rocks and iron. It is a little more than half the size of Earth. The most distinct feature about Mars is its red color. Out of the iron oxide covers the planet. It's as if the planet is rusting. White caps at the poles are water, forever frozen because of the colder temperatures further from the Sun. The only place the temperature rises above freezing is at the equator, or the middle of the planet. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos but they are much smaller than our own moon. It takes nearly twice as long for Mars to circle the sun at almost 687 days. The last part of the inner solar system is called the Asteroid Belt. It's the line between the inner rocky planets and the outer gas giant planets. Unlike the rest of the Inner Solar System, the Asteroid Belt isn't a planet at all. It is a bunch of large rocky chunks, mostly meteoroids. There is a dwarf planet named Ceres in the asteroid belt. The rest aren't very large. The Earth is the only planet that we know of with life on it; but the universe is a big place. Much of our solar system is still a mystery, there is still plenty to explore.",

      "Para": "Justin and Mary woke up early, even though they were vacationing at their uncle's lake house. The night before, Uncle Thomas told them about the Foggy Figure that haunts his lake. Justin and Mary were determined to see the ghostly creature before their vacation was over. \"It is foggy outside!\" Mary said, as Justin peered out the window. \"Yep! Let's go!\" Justin let go of the curtains and rushed to the door with Mary on his heels. It was only 5:00 AM, so everyone else in the house was still asleep. As they crept through the kitchen to the back door, Mary sniffed the air. It had the faint scent of coffee and something sweet. She shrugged it off and followed Justin out the door, down the back steps, and out onto the boat dock. The fog had settled over the lake, making it impossible to see anything. \"Do you see anything?\" Mary asked, leaning forward for a closer look. \"Nothing. Do you think Uncle Thomas was just trying to scare us with that story?\" Uncle Thomas did have a good imagination. Not close to giving up, Justin and Mary decided to wait longer, but this was their first scary adventure. Mary had a feeling it wasn't made up. Mary shook her head. \"Remember what Uncle Thomas said? The Foggy Figure haunts the lake. We're on the dock. Maybe that's why we can't see him. The people in the story were in boats.\" \"You want to go out on the water?\" Justin asked. Mary looked around, trying to find Uncle Thomas's boat, but the fog was too thick. \"Mom and Dad will be really angry if we go out on the lake alone in this fog.\" Justin said. \"We could sit in the boat without going anywhere. That wouldn't be dangerous.\" Okay. Justin walked toward the end of the dock. He could barely see the outline of the boat. \"I'll go first.\" He carefully lowered himself into the boat and then reached for Mary's hand. Mary climbed into the boat and sat beside him. She was getting nervous now that they were on the water. \"See anything?\" They looked around, and gradually, the fog began to lift. Mary turned around and screamed. \"The Foggy Figure!\" It was in the boat with them! Justin and Mary hugged each other in fear, but then they heard a laugh. Justin leaned toward the Foggy Figure. \"Uncle Thomas!\" \"I knew that story would get you two out of bed early enough to take a boat ride with me.\" Mary sighed, happy there was no Foggy Figure after all. Justin looked relieved, too. Uncle Thomas laughed. \"What do you say? I packed breakfast for us.\" Mary smiled. She had smelled coffee. And Uncle Thomas had packed pastries for them, too. \"Let's do it,\" Mary said. Justin agreed.",
